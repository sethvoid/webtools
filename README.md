#### Website footprinter 
This is a tool developed to ensure that backups have come back, its a comparitor taking a website from a set time and saving all the pages as hash values (content only no script or css) and then 
running a comparison with the current version, this script is useful for identifying which pages on a site have recently changed. 

#### photo ripper
Takes a page, scrapes it for image links, goes to the links and downloads the images, removes any meta data from the images, and saves them to a location.
